Case Study: LBBAP

EKG of the Patient with complete Heart block. 
Prior to treatment, the patient was symptomatic, and her heart rate was 30 bpm.

Treatment for CHB: Implantation of Pacemaker. Position of Lead placement in the Right Ventricular can play a vital role in deciding the therapy outcome for the patient. Pacing in the Apex of the ventricle can result in heart failure over time. 
In this case, we were able to place the RV lead in LBBA (left bundle branch area) which allows physiologic pacing and helps patient restore rhythm in a natural conduction path. Thus, a better treatment outcome. 	


 
 Post treatment Rhythm: Narrow QRS complex seen by lbbap, unlike traditional RV lead placement pacing. The post op report looks great, and the patient feels much better.
